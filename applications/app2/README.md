# app2
A demo of building context by including starters

App2Config is a main class, annotated with: @SpringBootApplication.

Starters packages name and placement have no matter.

You can change context by including/excluding starters.

**Advantages:**
* no need to have all projects in the same root package
* no need to specify base package in @SpringBootApplication annotation
